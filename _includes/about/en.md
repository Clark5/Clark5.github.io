Hi, this is Weitao Wang. I am a thrid-year Ph.D. student at [Rice University](https://www.rice.edu/), advised by [Prof. T. S. Eugene Ng](https://www.cs.rice.edu/~eugeneng/). I also work closely with [Prof. Ang Chen](https://www.cs.rice.edu/~angchen/). 

My current research focuses on application-infrastructure co-design, including programmable hardware, heterogeneous systems, distributed systems, data center network, systems for AI, and AI-powered systems.

I grew up in Anhui, China. And before joining Rice, I received my B.S. degree in Computer Science from [Shanghai Jiao Tong Univeristy](https://en.sjtu.edu.cn/) in 2018.
